```
sudo apt install git mtools syslinux wimtools -y
```

## Download Ubuntu

```
mkdir -p /mnt/iso
mount -o loop ~/Downloads/ubuntu-18.04.3-desktop-amd64.iso /mnt/iso
```
## Copy the Files

```
cd
mkdir -p ~/git
cd git
git clone https://github.com/kvellaNess/NxVMS_OS.git
```

Copy the modified files to the working directory
```
cp ~/git/NxVMS_OS/boot/grub/grub.cfg ~/preseed_ubuntu/boot/grub/grug.cfg
